    Hi,

    Thanks for signing up for a Greenlight account. We're excited to have you on board.

    For future reference, you user ID number is {{.userID}}.

    Please send a request to the `PUT /v1/users/activated` endpoint with the following JSON body
    to activate your account:

    {"token": "{{.activationToken}}"}

    For a React (say localhost:300) frontend and Go backend:

    To activate your Greenlight account, please click the following link: 

    http://localhost:3000/activate?token={{.activationToken}}

    The React frontend app should then display a button that says something 
    like "Confirm your account activation", and some JavaScript on the webpage can 
    extract the token from the URL and submit it to your PUT /v1/users/activate API 
    endpoint when the user clicks the button.

    Please note that this is one-time use token, and it will expire in 3 days.

    Thanks,

    The Greenlight Team

    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>Thanks for signing up for a Greenlight account. We're excited to have you on board!</p>
    <p>For future reference, your user ID number is {{.userID}}.</p>
    <p>Please send a request to the <code>PUT /v1/users/activated</code>endpoint
    with the following JSON body to acitvate your account:</p>
    <pre><code>
    {"token": "{{.activationToken}}"}
    </code></pre>

    <p> 
        For a React (say localhost:300) frontend and Go backend:

        To activate your Greenlight account, please click the following link: 

        <link href="http://localhost:3000/activate?token={{.activationToken}}" />

        The React frontend app should then display a button that says something 
        like "Confirm your account activation", and some JavaScript on the webpage can 
        extract the token from the URL and submit it to your PUT /v1/users/activate API 
        endpoint when the user clicks the button.

        We also need to take steps to avoid the token being leaked in a referrer header 
        if the user navigates to a different site. You can use the 
        Referrer-Policy: Origin header or <meta name="referrer" content="origin"> 
        HTML tag to mitigate this, although you should be aware that it's not 
        supported by absolutely all web browsers (support is currently at ~96%).
