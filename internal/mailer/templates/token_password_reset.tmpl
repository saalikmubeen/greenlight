{{define "subject"}} Reset your Greenlight password {{end}}

{{define "plainBody"}} 

Hi,
Please send a `PUT /v1/users/password` request with the following JSON body to set a new password: {"password": "your new password", "token": "{{.passwordResetToken}}"}

Please note that this is a one-time use token and it will expire in 45 minutes. If you need another token please make a `POST /v1/tokens/password-reset` request.



For a React (say localhost:300) frontend and Go backend:

To reset your password, please click the following link: 

<link href="http://localhost:3000/reset-password?token={{.passwordResetToken}}" />

The React frontend app should then display a form with a password and confirm
password input field. You can extract the token from the URL and submit it to 
your PUT /v1/users/password API endpoint when the user submits the form.

Again, if you go with this option, you need to take steps to avoid the token being 
leaked in a referrer header.


Thanks,
The Greenlight Team
